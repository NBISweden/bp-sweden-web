title: Download guide

This section provides guidelines on the necessary steps to download data from BigPicture.

## Install the sda-cli tool
Follow the guidelines [here](../submission/submission-guide.qmd#install-the-sda-cli-tool) to install the sda-cli tool.

## Generate the public and secret key
The initial step involves creating a crypt4gh keypair using the sda-cli:

```bash
./sda-cli createKey <keypair_name>
```

where `<keypair_name>` is the base name of the key files. The above command will create two keys files named
`keypair_name.pub.pem` and `keypair_name.sec.pem`. The public key (`pub`) will be sent to the admins
(see the next step) and will be used by them for the encryption of the files, while the private one
(`sec`) will be used by the requester for decrypting the files after downloading.


## Notify admins via email

Send an [email to the admins](mailto:{{< var email.helpdesk >}}) notifying them that you want to download files from BigPicture. Include the following information in the email:

* The dataset that the requester wants to download
* The crypt4gh public key (`keypair_name.pub.pem`) generated in the previous step

## Receive email from admins

Upon publicizing the encrypted data in a public folder, admins will send an email to the requester. This email will contain a URL that leads to a text file named `urls_list.txt`, which includes URLs of all requested datasets.

The number of URLs will be equal to the number of datasets requested for download.

## Download dataset

For downloading the data there only two elements needed: `sda-cli` and the URL for the `urls_list.txt` which was provided
to the requester in the previous step. The requester then can initiate the download of all the files by executing the following command:

```bash
./sda-cli download <url-for-the-urls_list.txt>
```

## Decrypt the files

The downloaded dataset files can be decrypted by using the `sda-cli`:

```bash
./sda-cli decrypt -key <keypair_name.sec.pem> <file-path>
```

Decrypt multiple files by appending file paths:

```bash
./sda-cli decrypt -key <keypair_name.sec.pem> <file-path-1> <file-path-2> <file-path-3> ...
```

## Validating decrypted files

During the publicize process, a file named `checksums_list.sha256` is generated, containing `sha256` checksums of all unencrypted files. Use this file to validate the correctness of downloaded files and ensure no issues occurred during the download.

## Notify us

Finally, send an [email to the admins](mailto:{{< var email.helpdesk >}}) to confirm the successful download and decryption or notifying them in case of an error.
