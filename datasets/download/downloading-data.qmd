This section provides guidelines on the necessary steps to download data from BigPicture.

## Get access to a dataset
The first step to download data from Big Picture is to get access to the dataset the user is interested in. This can be done by visiting REMS [here](https://bp-rems.sd.csc.fi/).
Log in, choose the datasets of interest and add them to the cart. After that, the user can apply for access, fill in the form and send the application.
The user needs to wait for approval from the data access committee (DAC) and after it has been approved the user can download the datasets.

## Preparation for downloading data

### Download configuration file
Before downloading the data, the user needs to download the configuration file by logging in [here](https://login.bp.nbis.se/).
Follow the dialogue to get authenticated and then click on `Download inbox s3cmd credentials` to download the configuration file named `s3cmd.conf`.

### Install the sda-cli tool
Follow the guidelines [here](../submission/submission-guide.qmd#install-the-sda-cli-tool) to install the sda-cli tool.

### Generate the public and secret key (**ONLY FOR ENCRYPTED DATA**)
The initial step involves creating a crypt4gh keypair using the sda-cli:

```bash
./sda-cli createKey <keypair_name>
```

where `<keypair_name>` is the base name of the key files. The above command will create two key files named
`keypair_name.pub.pem` and `keypair_name.sec.pem`. The public key (`pub`) will be sent to the admins
and will be used by the system for encryption of the files before downloading, while the private one
(`sec`) will be used by the requester for decrypting the files after downloading.

## Check access

After the user has been granted access to the dataset, the user can check access to the dataset by listing the datasets and their files using the `sda-cli`.
This can be done by following the instructions in the `List datasets and their files` section of the `sda-cli` documentation [here](https://github.com/NBISweden/sda-cli#list-datasets-and-their-files).

## Download data

After having acquired access to the datasets, the configuration file and the sda-cli tool, the user can download either decrypted data (in several ways) or encrypted data:

- Decrypted files:
    - using filepaths
    - using file IDs
    - recursively downloading all files in a folder
    - downloading files by providing a text file with the paths of the files to download
    - download all the files of the dataset

- Encrypted files:
    - download specific encrypted files

All the information for downloading files can be found in the sda-cli documentation in the `Download` section [here](https://github.com/NBISweden/sda-cli#download).
