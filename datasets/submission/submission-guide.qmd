## Sign and send Terms of Use from {#send-terms-of-use-form}

Please sign and send the Terms of Use form and submit it to [submit@bigpicture.org](mailto:submit@bigpicture.org).

## Install the sda-cli tool {#install-the-sda-cli-tool}

::: callout-note
This guide expects you to perform the following steps on the system
where you keep the data you intend to encrypt and submit.
:::

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
### Linux

1.  Download the `sda-cli` executable that matches your system from the
    [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NBISweden/sda-cli/releases/latest).


2.  Extract the binary by using the `tar` command:

    ``` bash
    tar -xvzf sda-cli_.vX_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    ```

    The `sda-cli` executable should now be in the same directory as the
    downloaded file.

### Mac

1.  Download the `sda-cli` executable that matches your system from the
    [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NBISweden/sda-cli/releases/latest).


2.  Extract the binary by using the `tar` command:

    ``` bash
    tar -xvzf sda-cli_.vX_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz
    ```

    The `sda-cli` executable should now be in the same directory as the
    downloaded file.

### Windows

1.  Download the `sda-cli` executable that matches your system from the
    [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NBISweden/sda-cli/releases/latest).


2.  Extract the binary by using the `tar` command:

    ``` bash
    tar -xvzf sda-cli_.vX_Windows_x86_64.zip
    ```

    The `sda-cli` executable should now be in the same directory as the
    downloaded file.
:::

::: callout-note
User documentation for `sda-cli` is available in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/NBISweden/sda-cli). This guide should
however include the information needed to encrypt and upload data to
BigPicture.
:::

## Download the encryption key {#download-the-encryption-key}

For BigPicture to be able to read the uploaded files, they need to be
encrypted with the correct public key. This key can be downloaded with
the following command:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
### Linux

``` bash
curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NBISweden/EGA-SE-user-docs/main/crypt4gh_bp_key.pub
```

### Mac

``` bash
curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NBISweden/EGA-SE-user-docs/main/crypt4gh_bp_key.pub
```

### Windows

``` bash
curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NBISweden/EGA-SE-user-docs/main/crypt4gh_bp_key.pub
```
:::

## Encrypt the files {#encrypt-the-files}

1.  Encrypt the files

    Now that you have the public key, and the tools you need, you can
    encrypt the submission files. An encryption key will be created
    automatically by the tool.

    ::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
    ### Linux

    ``` bash
    ./sda-cli encrypt -key crypt4gh_bp_key.pub <file_1_to_encrypt> <file_2_to_encrypt> ...
    ```

    ### Mac

    ``` bash
    ./sda-cli encrypt -key crypt4gh_bp_key.pub <file_1_to_encrypt> <file_2_to_encrypt> ...
    ```


    ### Windows

    ``` bash
    sda-cli encrypt -key crypt4gh_bp_key.pub <file_1_to_encrypt> <file_2_to_encrypt> ...
    ```
    :::

    The tool will automatically create checksum files called:

        checksum_encrypted.md5
        checksum_encrypted.sha256
        checksum_unencrypted.md5
        checksum_unencrypted.sha256

    Make sure to save these files, you will need them during submission.

## Submit your files {#submit-your-files}

Once your files are encrypted, you are ready to start uploading them.

1.  Obtain the configuration file

    The `sda-cli` tool requires a configuration file with the relevant
    settings. You can get the configuration file by [logging in to our
    service](https://login.bp.nbis.se/).

2.  Upload the files

    Files can be uploaded with or without folders. Files can be uploaded
    individually using:

    ::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
    ### Linux

    ``` bash
    ./sda-cli upload -config <configuration_file> <encrypted_file_1_to_upload> <encrypted_file_2_to_upload> ...
    ```

    ### Mac

    ``` bash
    ./sda-cli upload -config <configuration_file> <encrypted_file_1_to_upload> <encrypted_file_2_to_upload> ...
    ```


    ### Windows

    ``` bash
    sda-cli upload -config <configuration_file> <encrypted_file_1_to_upload> <encrypted_file_2_to_upload> ...
    ```
    :::

    The folder structure of the uploaded files will be preserved in the
    remote archive.

    Many times it might be easier to upload a directory directly though.
    This can be done with the `-r` flag:

    ::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

    ### Linux

    ``` bash
    ./sda-cli upload -config <configuration_file> -r <folder_to_upload>
    ```

    ### Mac

    ``` bash
    ./sda-cli upload -config <configuration_file> -r <folder_to_upload>
    ```

    ### Windows

    ``` bash
    sda-cli upload -config <configuration_file> -r <folder_to_upload>
    ```
    :::

    <!--
    NOTE: this is an upcoming feature
    Once the upload is finished, you can verify that the correct files are
    uploaded, using the `list` command:
   
    ```bash
    ./sda-cli list -config <configuration_file> <upload_folder>
    ```
    You should now be able to see the file and potentially others stored in
    `<upload_folder>`. 
    -->

    More information on the capabilites of the `sda-cli` can be found
    using the tool's built-in help:

    ::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}

    ### Linux
    
    ``` bash
    ./sda-cli help
    ```
    
    ### Mac
    
    ``` bash
    ./sda-cli help
    ```
    
    ### Windows
    
    ``` bash
    sda-cli help
    ```
