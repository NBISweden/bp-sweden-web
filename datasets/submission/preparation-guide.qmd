Before you submit your data, please make sure

1. The root folder of the submission should actually be the dataset folder which includes several subfolders. See the example of structure folder below:
```
    DATASET_{IDENTIFIER}
    |--- METADATA
    | |--- dataset.xml (contains: Dataset)
    | |--- policy.xml (contains: Policy)
    | |--- image.xml (contains: Images)
    | |--- annotation.xml (contains: Annotations) 
    | |--- observation.xml (contains: Observations)
    | |--- observer.xml (contains: Observers)
    | |--- sample.xml (contains: Biological Beings, Cases (if present), Specimens, Blocks and Slides)
    | |--- staining.xml (contains: Stainings)
    |---IMAGES
    | |--- IMAGE_{IDENTIFIER}*
    | | |--- *.dcm files of an Image
    | |--- IMAGE_{IDENTIFIER}*
    | | |--- *.dcm files of an Image
    |--- ANNOTATIONS+
    | |--- *.geojson
    |--- LANDING_PAGE***
    | |--- landingpage.xml (contains: Landing Page) 
    | |--- THUMBNAILS
    | | |--- *.jpg
    |--- PRIVATE**** - not shared with users
    | |--- rems.xml - not shared with users
    | |--- organisation.xml - not shared with users
    | |--- datacite.xml (contains: DataCite, optional) - not shared with users

    * The root of the folder must be the written as "DATASET_{IDENTIFIER}" with IDENTIFIER being either the accession ID of 
    the Dataset generated by the repository (when data is downloaded), or the ALIAS defined by the submitter at dataset creation 
    and submission.
    ** Folders containing WSIs files (I.e. *.dcm) must be named "IMAGE_{IDENTIFIER}" with IDENTIFIER being either the 
    accession ID of a given Image the files relate to generated by the repository (when data is downloaded), or the ALIAS defined 
    by the submitter at dataset creation or submission.
    *** IMPORTANT: Anything in this folder should be expected to be visible to the entire world.
    + If the dataset does not contain Annotations the respective .xml files or directory can be omitted.
    **** This folder contains metadata that will not be shared with users that have gotten access to a dataset
```

2. All the files should be encrypted with crypt4gh and the extensions must be `c4gh`, e.g:
`image.xml.c4gh`, `image1.dcm.c4gh` etc
3. The metadata should be stored in two different subfolders: `METADATA` and `PRIVATE`.
4. The only files that may exist in the `METADATA` folder are the following: `dataset.xml`, `image.xml`, `observation.xml`, `observer.xml` (optional), `policy.xml`, `sample.xml`, `annotation.xml` (optional) and `staining.xml`.
5. The only files that may exist in the `PRIVATE` folder are the following: `dac.xml` and `submission.xml`.
6. The file `image.xml` should include the full path of each dicom image and includes also the checksums of both encrypted and unencrypted files, e.g:
```
    <FILES>
        <FILE filename="IMAGES/IMAGE_{IDENTIFIER}/*.dcm" checksum_method="SHA256" checksum="<encrypted_checksum>" unencrypted_checksum="<unencrypted_checksum>" filetype="dcm"/>
    </FILES>
```
