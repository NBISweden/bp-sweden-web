## Configuring the website

General settings are stored in the file `_quarto.yml`, global variables in
the file `_variables.yml`, and variables that might need to be changed using
environment variables in `_environment`.

Settings that are specific to the deployed version are set in [github
environment](https://github.com/NBISweden/bp-sweden-web/settings/environments).
The local configuration of these variables should be set in the file
`_environment.local`, which will not be tracked by git:

```

SKULD=url_to_skuld
```
