---
BigPicture Sweden aims to support submissions of digital pathology slides resulting from biomedical research projects. You can read more about data types and file formats on the [BigPicture dataset website](https://nbisweden.github.io/hugo.bp.datasets.nbis.se/). 


Before you submit your data, please make sure

1. The folder name is set as the dataset name.
2. All files are [encrypted with crypt4gh](uploading-data.qmd#encrypt-the-files) and the file extensions are `c4gh`.
3. The metadata is stored in a folder called `metadata` under the root of the submission folder.
4. The file `images.xml.c4gh` includes the full path of each dicom image and includes also the checksums of both encrypted and unencrypted files.
