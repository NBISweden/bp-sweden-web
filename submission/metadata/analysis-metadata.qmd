title: Analysis metadata
---

Files resulting from bioinformatic analyses may be submitted as analysis
data. If you wish to include this category of data, make sure to
document your analyses carefully. The purpose of the analysis metadata
is to describe both how the analyses was done and any files resulting
from them.

Phenotype descriptions that cannot be shared openly will also have to be
submitted as analysis data. During the submission, you will be asked to
provide simple publicly available descriptions of your submitted files.
