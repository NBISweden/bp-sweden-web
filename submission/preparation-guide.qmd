BigPicture aims to support submissions of digital pathology slides resulting from biomedical research projects. You can read more about data types and file formats on the [BigPicture dataset website](https://nbisweden.github.io/datasets.bp.nbis.se/).


Before you submit your data, please make sure

1. The root folder of the submission should actually be the dataset folder which includes the images folder and the metadata folder. See the example of structure folder below:
```
    ├── Dataset_whatever
    |   ├── metadata
    |   |   ├── images.xml
    |   |   ├── dataset.xml
    |   |   ├── dac.xml
    |   ├── IMG_001
    |   |   ├── image1.dcm
    |   |   ├── image2.dcm
    |   |   ├── image3.dcm
    |   ├── IMG_002
    |   |   ├── image1.dcm
    |   |   ├── image2.dcm
    |   |   ├── image3.dcm
    |   ├── IMG_003
    |   |   ├── image1.dcm
    |   |   ├── image2.dcm
    |   |   ├── image3.dcm
```

2. All the files should be encrypted with crypt4gh and the extensions must be `c4gh`, e.g:
`images.xml.c4gh`, `image1.dcm.c4gh` etc
3. The metadata is stored in a folder called `metadata` under the root of the submission folder.
4. The only files that should exist in the `metadata` folder are the following: `dac.xml`, `dataset.xml`, `images.xml`, `observations.xml`, `observers.xml`, `policy.xml`, `samples.xml` and `study.xml`.
5. The file `images.xml.c4gh` should include the full path of each dicom image and includes also the checksums of both encrypted and unencrypted files, e.g:
```
    <FILES>
        <FILE filename="IMG_001/image1.dcm" checksum_method="SHA256" checksum="<encrypted_checksum>" unencrypted_checksum="<unencrypted_checksum>" filetype="dcm"/>
        <FILE filename="IMG_001/image2.dcm" checksum_method="SHA256" checksum="<encrypted_checksum>" unencrypted_checksum="<unencrypted_checksum>" filetype="dcm"/>
        <FILE filename="IMG_001/image3.dcm" checksum_method="SHA256" checksum="<encrypted_checksum>" unencrypted_checksum="<unencrypted_checksum>" filetype="dcm"/>
    </FILES>
```
